# Health Education England - Frontend prototype

This codebase contains the assets, components, templates ant tooling used to compile the frontend for Health Education
England's (HEE) different websites / channels.

The compiled prototype is hosted on GitHub Pages, and can be viewed here:
[https://health-education-england.github.io/hee-prototypes/](https://health-education-england.github.io/hee-prototypes/)

It is based off the [NHS UK prototype kit](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend), making use of existing components
and styles where possible. You can find more information on the NHS UK design system and it's components [here.](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)
