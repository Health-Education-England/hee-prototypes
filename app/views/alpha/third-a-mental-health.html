{% block pageContent %}
  <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health, and it is vital for the NHS to provide services to its patients. There are a range of ways that health professionals can be involved in the provision of mental health services across different professions and roles. Multi-disciplinary working is a key aspect of providing high quality mental health services.</p>

  <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
  <p>Mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realises his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.</p>
  <p>Mental health is a broad concept that encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and it can also influence our physical health.</p>
